This patch turns OFF Google/Microsoft OAuth and leaves:
- Email/password signup (with email verification)
- SMTP accounts only (with incoming IMAP or POP, plus CSV import)

Apply:
1) Unzip into your repo root and overwrite files.
2) Commit & push.
3) Ensure dependencies include 'poplib' (for POP3). If not installed, run:
   npm i poplib

Vercel env must include:
- DATABASE_URL
- NEXTAUTH_URL
- NEXTAUTH_SECRET
- SMTP_HOST, SMTP_PORT, SMTP_SECURE, SMTP_USER, SMTP_PASS, SMTP_FROM (for verification emails)
